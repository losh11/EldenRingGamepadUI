# Elden Ring Gamepad UI
This mod patches the internal texture layout files for Elden Ring to use Dualsense or Dualshock UI for buttons prompts and gamepad (settings screen).

## Tools

Unpacking game files: [ER.BDT.Tool](https://github.com/Ekey/ER.BDT.Tool/) by Ekey

Unpacking/repacking internal files: [Yabber](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yabber/) by JKAnderson

Visual verification of game texture: Paint.net and .dds mod for Paint.net

Editing layout files: Sublime Text because VSCode on my computer died the other day
